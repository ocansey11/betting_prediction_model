# Betting Prediction Models

This directory contains notebooks and scripts related to training and testing various prediction models for betting outcomes.

## Overview

In this project, we aim to develop machine learning models to predict the outcomes of football matches in the English Premier League. These models utilize features such as team statistics, match history, and other relevant data to generate predictions for upcoming matches.

## Notebooks

1. **Betting Prediction Model - Comparing Classifiers:** This notebook compares different classification models to determine the most effective approach for predicting match outcomes. It evaluates metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess model performance. Its found outside this directory but very vital for the models within this dir

2. **Betting Prediction Model - Logistic Regression:** This notebook focuses on training a logistic regression model for predicting match outcomes. It includes data preprocessing steps, model training, evaluation, and performance analysis.

3. **Betting Prediction Model - Random Forest:** This notebook explores the use of random forest classifiers for match outcome prediction. It includes hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation to optimize model performance.

4. **RBF SVM**: iM NEW TO THIS SO I CANT WAIT

## Usage

To use the models in this directory, follow these steps:

1. Open the desired notebook or script in your preferred Python environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab).
2. Execute the cells or run the script to train and test the prediction models.
3. Evaluate the performance of the models using the provided metrics.
4. Adjust parameters or explore different models as needed to improve prediction accuracy.

## Dependencies

The models in this directory require the following Python libraries:

- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn

Make sure to install these dependencies before running the notebooks or scripts.

## Disclaimer

The predictions generated by these models are based on statistical analysis and machine learning algorithms. While efforts have been made to ensure the accuracy of the predictions, they should be used for informational purposes only. We do not guarantee the accuracy or reliability of the predictions, and we are not liable for any losses or damages resulting from their use.
